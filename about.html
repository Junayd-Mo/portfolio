        Welcome to my portfolio! My journey into the world of coding began in
        Year 10, when I was introduced to the fascinating world of programming.
        The initial steps involved grasping the basics through pseudocode and
        trace tables which turnt into the successful completion of my GCSE in
        Computer Science in 2020. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <!-- Eager to explore new horizons, I embarked on a gap year between my GCSEs
        and A levels, immersing myself in the study of Arabic abroad. This
        enriching experience broadened my perspectives and provided a unique
        backdrop for my subsequent academic endeavors. <br />
        <br /> -->

        In June 2023, I proudly attained an A level in both Mathematics and
        Computer Science. It was during this period that my attraction to
        software development truly came out. Delving into the theoretical
        aspects of software and grappling with abstract concepts, I found myself
        surprised by the immense possibilities that the world of programming
        held. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Post A levels, I took a big step towards transforming my passion into a
        tangible skill set. Enrolling in a rigorous bootcamp, I underwent
        intensive training to solidify my knowledge in software development.
        This amazing experience not only honed my coding abilities but also
        served as a stepping stone for a series of exciting projects, allowing
        me to put my newfound skills into practice. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Looking ahead, my aspirations center around becoming a full-stack
        software engineer. I am driven by the desire to turn my passion into a
        fulfilling career, using my skills to create innovative solutions. Join
        me on this exciting journey as I continue to evolve and strive towards
        turning dreams into reality.
